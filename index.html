      </div>
      <p> Recently picked up the hobby after some time driving and wishing for a more healthy form of transportation. I really enjoy the excuse to get some cardio in whenever possible.
    <h3>Cyberpunk, Dungeons and Dragons and W40K
      <div class="tabletop">
      <img src="coverphoto.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>I really like GMing, DMing, being a Ref, you name it! And honestly with there being so many different RPGs, I always feel tempted to hold a game for a few friends in a RPG system, if they're willing.</p>
    <h3>Coding Events
      <p>Not to hammer in the point too vigorously, but I do enjoy in my leisure time(when I have leisure time) hackathons and coding meetups.</p>
